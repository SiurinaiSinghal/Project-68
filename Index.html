        <h1>About</h1>
          <div class="line"></div>
       <h2>The concept of ‘Our World’ forms the basis of K.R. Mangalam . Learning, irrespective of the source, is learning we would derive from the world over, to educate and inspire children towards achievement.

</h2>

        <p>The K R Mangalam World School, Vaishali is located on an environment friendly lush green 3 acre campus. It is very well connected by road and metro-rail. Transport facility is provided to areas of Ghaziabad, Delhi and NOIDA. The school is a fully air-conditioned school catering to the educational needs of children from 2 to 18 years of age. It has state of the art infrastructure for all curricular and co-curricular activities with smart class rooms for all grades from Toddler to Grade XII. The KRM World School is affiliated with the Central Board of Secondary Education; the students of the school have done their Alma Mater proud, year after year, by excelling in the examinations conducted by the Board. The school alumni have been well placed in top colleges both within the country and overseas. The teaching-learning methodology adopted across all classes ensures experiential and hands-on learning with a keen focus on developing the skills of collaboration, communication, critical thinking and innovation. The aim is to give the children wings to soar high in the pursuit of their dreams.

While academics are the key focus area of the school, we believe that every child is unique and has an innate talent; it is the philosophy of the school to help the child identify and nurture the talent in him. To achieve this aim, sports, games, performing arts, visual arts robotics, astronomy and culinary arts have been incorporated within the weekly curriculum. Specialised coaching in Taekwondo, Gymnastics, Skating, Basketball, Cricket, Football, Hockey, Volleyball, Table-tennis and Badminton amongst other games has made it possible for students to do well in these games at the State, National as well as International levels. Our commitment to the environment is exemplified in the rain-water harvesting, vermin composting and sewage treatment plants that are located in the school.

The faculty of the school is not only qualified but is dedicated to their calling – to enable the child to be the best version of her/himself. For the teachers of the K R M World School, teaching is not a profession but is a vocation – commitment, dedication, integrity, sincerity, diligence and assiduousness are the hallmarks of each. At the K R Mangalam World School, we believe that the child is the centroid of a triangle that is formed with the school, the home and the community forming the three vertices – each is working for the all-embracive development of the child. For this, regular PTMs ensure the tandem working of the school and the home. A very active community outreach programme – SCOPE- ensures that the students empathise with and work towards the upliftment of the needy. A value-based approach to teaching ensures that the children grow up to be good human beings with a commitment to responsible citizenship. The school motto ‘Together Towards Tomorrow’ encourages the students to have a collective aim of collaboratively taking the country to greater heights.
